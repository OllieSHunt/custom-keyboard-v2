# Repository Layout
- `./circit_board` = KiCad design files
- `./kicad-libs` = Third party libraries that KiCad can use
- `./firmware` = QMK firmware *TODO*

# Components List
- Custom circuit board
- Raspberry Pi Pico (without headers, and I use the original Pi Pico, not the v2)
- Gateron Low Profile Switch 2.0, brown (can be swapped for any other colour, you need 46 of these)
- WOMIER Low Profile Keycaps (can be swapped for any other compatible keycaps, you need 46 of these)
